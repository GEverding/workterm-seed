## UW Work Term Report Seed
This is my basic setup for my workterm reports.  It is written in (markdown)[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/] 
and compiled to PDF using (Pandoc)[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html].  If you haven't hear of Pandoc you should
really give it a look.

## Install
1. Latex
2. (Haskell)[http://www.haskell.org/platform/]
3. (Pandoc)[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html].

## Build
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:GEverding/workterm-seed.git awesome-report
$ cd awesome-report
$ make
```
